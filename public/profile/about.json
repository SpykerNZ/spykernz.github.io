    "about": "Hey there, I'm Jamie! I'm an engineer with 5+ years of experience in the automation industry. I primarily specialize in software development, and have been involved with many different platforms and technologies. I am currently employed as a software developer, working on some exciting projects at a small automation company in Christchurch.\n\n I have always been drawn to automating tasks, whether it be a small piece of software or a full on robotic system. I enjoy designing and building systems from scratch, and find it really satisfying when a program comes together successfully in a tidy, elegant manner. With traditional automation hardware, I'm interested in seeing where I can applying modern programming techniques and methodolgies.\n\n I also enjoy dabbling in areas such as computer vision, machine learning, web development and internet of things. Outside of the work week I keep busy with cooking experiments, neighbourhood runs, heading up to the slopes, creating theatrical performances and automating bits and pieces around the house.\n\n  I'm always interested in hearing about exciting opportunites and making new connections, so don't be afraid to say hi!",
